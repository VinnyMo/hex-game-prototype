# Hex Game Prototype - Claude Context

## Project Overview
Real-time multiplayer hex grid strategy game with 500+ concurrent users.

## Key Files
- `server.js` - Main server with Express/Socket.io
- `game-logic/game.js` - Core game mechanics (lines 55-64 contain disconnection fix)
- `public/js/drawing.js` - Client-side rendering
- `public/js/event-handlers.js` - Socket event handling
- `game.db` - SQLite database

## Recent Work
### Disconnection Penalty Race Condition Fix ✅
**Problem**: Tiles incorrectly blinking red and losing population due to race condition in `getConnectedTiles()` function.

**Solution**: Modified line 59 in `game-logic/game.js`:
```javascript
// OLD: if (tile && tile.owner === owner)
// NEW: if (tile && tile.owner === owner && !tile.isDisconnected)
```

This prevents disconnected tiles from being included in BFS connectivity checks, eliminating the oscillation between connected/disconnected states.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Server logs show normal disconnection penalty execution without errors.

## Performance Optimizations Completed
- Visual cascade effects for exclamation captures
- Population-based height visualization  
- Z-index rendering for 3D cityscape effect
- Optimized tile loading and caching
- Reduced animation overhead for 500+ users

## Commands to Run
- Start server: `node server.js`
- View logs: `tail -f server.log`
- Check processes: `ps aux | grep node`

## Current Status
All major issues resolved. Server running stable with 573 active users.
